  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Some work done on Codecademy from this half term.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To recap some work done previously to revise for next week's python syntax test, and to carry on with lists and dictionaries.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, I do think that I balanced out my work efficiently to allow both tasks to be done.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I persevered on the work all around, so that I could get more things actually done on the lesson, so I was better prepared for the test.</td>

    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>N/A</td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I independently worked on the task, not using the 'Give me the Solution' button at all.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected on the things that I am not so sure about in the syllabus, and used the time in the lesson to do some work on that.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged with the task at hand: when the class was being a bit silly when the teacher left the classroom, I did not mess about, because I wanted to use the lesson efficiently.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The lesson was mainly about getting things done as quickly as you can, whilst understanding the language to a good extent (efficiency). I believe that I did this quite well, and really therefore have not much to improve. All I can say is to maybe have spent more time on the revision, because I think it is unlikely that lists and dictionaries would come up in this test.</td>
