  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>One quarter of the way through my program.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To hopefully get halfway through, if not more.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Barely, but I went and refined my code.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I really persevered during the lesson, making good progress on the game, and giving the person sitting next to me some advice with his script.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>N/A</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I consistently worked independently throughout the lesson, except from when I didn't remember to cast my string to an integer, so I asked the teacher.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected on how I could have made my code more efficient. For example, using 15 if statements was much more repetitive than 1 for x in range(0, 15), so I changed it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged fully with the task, especially because it is due next week.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Look at things that could be changed, for the better of my code, whether it be to be more efficient, run quicker, or add effect to the program to further enhance it</td>
