<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Like last week, I have a fair amount of knowledge of python, because of work inside and outside lessons.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>The target for this week's lesson is practically the same as the aim for last lesson: to progress on the Codecademy course for Python.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, and I did progress well.</td>
  </tr>

    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I persevered when trying to come up with some solutions, because the one that I had presented was apparently wrong. I then noticed it was because I had made a trivial error, forgetting a colon.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I asked myself some questions, not just to do with the python, but what to do to improve this website, which is for homework, too.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I worked independently on the work given to us quite well.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected on my work from last week, and compared it to how much I had done this week.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged with the task, and got a lot accomplished.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Again, I am stuck in the same dilemma as last week: nothing really went wrong. I could try and really push myself to achieve more, but I do believe it went quite well.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>All I could actually say is the same as last week: engage more and don't focus on any distractions.</td>
    <td></td>
