    <td class="title">Starting point:</td>
    <td>Like last week, I have a fair amount of knowledge of python, because of work inside and outside lessons.</td>

    <td class="title">Persevering</td>
    <td>I persevered when trying to come up with some solutions, because the one that I had presented was apparently wrong. I then noticed it was because I had made a trivial error, forgetting a colon.</td>

    <td class="title">Questioning?</td>
    <td>I asked myself some questions, not just to do with the python, but what to do to improve this website, which is for homework, too.</td>
