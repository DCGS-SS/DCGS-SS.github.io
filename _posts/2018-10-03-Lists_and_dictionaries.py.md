  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I persevered while looking at what I needed to do for a task. My mind went blank at one moment, and I had to actually reflect on what I had done previously to help me. One I got a faint reminder of what the answer could be, I persevered to 'solve the jigsaw puzzle'. This could be put in the reflecting box, but I really think that I persevered more here.</td>
