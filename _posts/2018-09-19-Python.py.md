<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Some knowledge on Python, because I have previously used the Codecademy course to learn outside of lessons.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To review everything that I have previously studied, and work on some new things.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, I reached my target.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I persevered by working through these quickly and efficiently.</td>
  </tr>

    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I asked some questions (not 'HELP ME!') which were useful just for learning.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I worked independently on the task set.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td>I reflected on what I had done last summer, to help me with this work.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I fully engaged with the task at hand, and was not distracted by anything.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As the blog says, I feel that I have done a lot of good work today, and I really donâ€™t think that I could improve anything. However, there is not really a limit to how efficiently you can work during a lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to just try and work more efficiently and engage with the task more.</td>
  </tr>
