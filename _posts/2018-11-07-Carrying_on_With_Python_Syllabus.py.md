    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>No, not really, because our teacher had left a post on G.C. asking for the link to our blog submitted, and lots of people were asking me for help.</td>

    <td>Persevering</td>

    <td>To improve MY learning experience, I should not have helped at all, but I think that would just be selfish and rude. Even if it does hinder my learning experience, I do believe that it is something I should have done. However, there should be a balance towards the two, and maybe I could have managed that better.</td>
